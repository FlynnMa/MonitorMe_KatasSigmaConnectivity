# Identifier and Title (a statement of the decision made)
Device function entity

## Status
Draft

## Context
Hardware device abstraction on-premises system.

## Evaluation Criteria
Reliability,

Security,
  Data is reported in secure channel

Availability,
  Data is

Performance,


### Reliability and Accessibility
  Sample rate vs reporting rate
  Each device is able to sample multiple times on each report
  Each device is able to report it's availability periodically(sanity status)
  If any of vital sign device or software fails, MonitorMe must still function for other vital sign monitoring

### Portability
The ability of the system to run on multiple platforms

### Privacy
The ability of the system to hide data from internal and external users

### Scalability
The ability of the system to operate consistently as the number of users increases
