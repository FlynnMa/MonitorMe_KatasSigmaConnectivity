# DECISION-MAKING MYTHS
Quashing some myths around decision making can lead to a clearer and faster decision-making process.

## Myth 1: Decision making is linear
Decision making should be an agile process, iterating over the ADR or proposal until it is decided and revisiting past decisions as needed.

The longer you put off a decision, the more information you have to base that decision on, but decisions cannot be put off forever. New information arises and circumstances change, which may affect decisions in progress or that have already been decided. This is a very good reason to record decisions using ADRs. You want to be able to revisit ADRs and reuse the information and analysis in them, saving effort on new decisions.

## Myth 2: Giving more choices is better for making decisions
Although you might think that presenting or gathering more options improves your chances of finding the best one, research shows that people are less likely to make a decision when given lots of options and less likely to be happy with the result.3 All options have pros and cons, and evaluating many options, each with its own pros and cons, is a much higher mental load than fewer options.

Where possible, create an ADR or proposal with no more than three options and use abstractions such as star ratings and tables to help readers compare them.

## Myth 3: The decision should be made by the most senior person
The most senior person, or person with the most authority, is not necessarily the best person to have the final say. The person with the most expertise, or who will be affected the most by the outcome, should be the decision owner and own the decision and the process of making it.

The decision owner should understand the problem space and possible solutions and use research and contributions from others to bolster their knowledge. They will take the decision process through to a conclusion.

## Myth 4: All stakeholders should be involved in the feedback process
Each stakeholder will be affected differently by the decision. The decision owner should ensure that stakeholders who are important to the success of implementing the decision have the chance to give input and commit to whatever the outcome is.

Some stakeholders are useful to consult as you draft the ADR, helping to identify concerns or holes in the proposed options. You will find that some stakeholders do not need to be involved in the decision-making process but will need to be informed of the outcome.

## Myth 5: You should ask for all kinds of feedback
Be specific and tailor your requests for feedback to each stakeholder. Generic feedback is often not useful for making a decision and can mean relevant feedback is harder to find and use. Ask involved stakeholders to do the following:

Let you know if anything in your ADR or proposal is unclear.
Ask clarifying questions if they need to.
Provide feedback only when they are sure they understand fully.
You can update the ADR (before it is decided) to answer questions from stakeholders or to improve clarity. Once the decision is made, communicate it to all stakeholders.

## Myth 6: All stakeholders must agree on the outcome
Stakeholders need to commit to the outcome to make it successful but do not all need to agree that the outcome is the best solution.

Once all relevant stakeholders have been consulted, it is the decision owner who will make the decision. The decision owner must then ask all relevant stakeholders to either commit or not. Any stakeholder who thinks the outcome is unsafe needs to explain why, and the decision owner must work with them to address their concerns. Stakeholders can also indicate if they agree or disagree with the decision, but commitment is key to success.

When all relevant stakeholders have committed to the outcome, the decision can be finalized. Then the decision will not be revisited unless new information emerges, at which point a new decision process will start, the outcome of which will override the original decision. In this case, your original ADR’s status would change from Decided to Superseded.

## Myth 7: The decision owner can make a rational decision
In “Battling Bias”, I covered some of the biases that everyone is subject to. The decision owner gets input from relevant stakeholders in an attempt to mitigate at least some of these biases. You must be aware of the biases you and others involved hold. Keeping these in mind will help, but you can never totally eliminate bias.

As mentioned, requiring that the stakeholders involved commit rather than agree is a way to mitigate groupthink. When members of the group are not expecting full group consensus, they are more likely to express dissenting viewpoints and critically analyze the options in front of them.
