The system should analyze each patientâ€™s vital signs and alert a medical professional if it detects an issue (e.g., decrease in oxygen level) or reaches a preset threshold (e.g., temperature has reached 104 degrees F).

Some trend and threshold analysis should be dependent on whether the patient is awake or asleep.

The system should support a maximum number of 500 patients per physical MonitorMe instance.
