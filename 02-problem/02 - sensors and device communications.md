The system should read data from eight different patient-monitoring equipment vital sign input sources: heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen level, blood sugar, respiration rate, electrocardiogram (ECG), body temperature, and sleep status (sleep or awake).

If any of vital sign device (or software) fails, the system must still function for other vital sign monitoring (monitor, record, analyze, and alert).
The system should be able to function even if one of the vital sign devices fails.
